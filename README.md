###Story


###Basic concepts

there has to be no difference between new and old player in terms of how difficult it is to beat anything

everything has to be about showing you that you are becoming better, that will be the point of playing more


you could play to get more play time? can that even work?


slow down play by difficulty

won't having map transitions break the immersion? wont not having them kill the supsense or create feeling of danger in safe places?

blood and magic, yu gi oh

some skill can be assined only to work with right bumber and directed to where right stick is pointing on console and same with mouse look and mouse right click on pc

player customization, hear, somethin to make him look like the person playing+++

playable on controller

there has to be no decisions that can't be reverted

items have skill slots, up to 4 (or 6?)

no levels or exp?
will mmo without leveling be fun? isnt gathering better weapons and spells also leveling?


if the armor didnt work you could wear same cloths as yi gi oh and it would be stupid to equip something different

also without armors i can reduce amount of animations i need
robe of any color you want but you have to find them

also without items and levels game will be much easier to make, so i could use it as first prototype for the mmorpg engine



playstyle changing content can be available at start but it has to work like this:
 - 4 skills at the time
 - no changing skills inside battle 
 - all skills can be bought immediately for same low price that you will get to in few minutes of gameplay

so you wont need more then 4 skils


every next skill cost more? unless you sell some skills? 

    

parody on mmorpgs?

hand-crafted dungeons?
generated dungons?

you need to change your skillset/playstyle for different dungeons


Elemental damage?
casting water spell and then electric spell

### Items
###### Sword
 slot 1 -  
#####3 magic tome
 slot 1 -



you gain small amounts of currency, maybe not for killing every enemy, but for completing certain parts of story/dungeon/quest/event

it has to be something abstract, like crystals or card slots and not money


card size? different card slots, in a book for cards?

shiny cards? that would mean that tier 1 -> 2 -> 3 would have to work

shiny cards? special slots for them


1 character slot, you can buy more for real money - character personality is important so you will not want to kill your character

no idea if there can be some material progress for intentional perma death as that would take long, maybe something cosmetic - like halo for sacrificing yourself


at the start you have not to feel overhelmed at all cost!



you decide which button activets which skill by game telling you to use it, and you press any button and it will bind the more you press it

you can rebind only at test courses learnign you the abilities? that would be interesting but little tedious. but how often do you rebind? well it might happen if you create binding yourself
maybe it will tell you to press L1 for dash or any button you want, but if you press anything it will just bind that key
you were transferd to different realm, so maybe you lost your body and learning to use new one after all

every aspect of playing the game has to be part of the game itself (controls - described above, login - somehow, ambient music)
so you will feel more like the avatar, which is actually you even though at the start it seems that someone else was sucked in the game

start the game blurry? so it seems like you were just transfer into avatars conciousnes (enter the void)




start at a tutorial dungeon, its a way to "sanctuary" the only town in world


there are ways to different dungeons like in shadow of collosus
world has to feel empty, wind, lonely music, etc

there might be something weird but earth like in the sanctuary, like humanoids with deer heads or something abstract, but i dont know of abstract things that can interact with you and sell you stuff and look earth like - it could be statues. statues of deer people :)

but the area will be much smaller, and maybe just something like weird ruins in sotc


maybe i could lock content behind progression that is not grinding but completing other content - itself it won't work as i dont have infinite content, but with combination of other things it could be nother progression. but it locks content so you cant do everything from start. maybe unlock tier 1 -> 2 -> 3 dungeons that are harder versions. permanently! that it, if you unlock it permanently over perma death then its ok because that content is not for beginner skills anyway

lock content behind content? do i have to?
lock content that is too difficult and perma-unlock it after you finish easier content
this means it will never happen that you start the game and cant play hard dungeon with your friend, because you dont know how to play hard dungeon

it can never happen that i've done 1 hard dungeon and now i have to play easy dungeon to unlock another hard one
maybe it qcan if it requires different playstyle that you dont know, so normal with right playstyle - normal, normal with your wrong playstyle - hard. this means you can enjoy new playstyle in new dungeon even if its easier.

all dungeons should be hard, the unlockable content has to be insane and not for normal players





dungeon that you can complete only at certain time (game time probably)


in story you get split and you get to see the other person on your screen via some magical video device so you can cooperate



dont stop characters during dialog, allow them to move, never restrain character by game (or at least not without mentioning it)



you come to game and have 1 skill (play style) until few minuts in game where you get 2 skill (two play styles) then you will get a choice of third supporting 1st or 2nd playstyle - it has to be obvious this change isnt permanent and you can buy both of those skills after some grind



you can grind for resurrection crystals or something like that that will reconstruct your avatar, that when used at dungeon door will cause you to ressurect at the door - there will be altar. and if you dont want to use them you need no to. maybe for bigger rewards at the end - shiny cards?



time travel dungeon
you will see yourself in future pushing button closing some path
in future you will be forced to push the button by falling rock or die

personality, either 1 or 5 characteristics

you shape your character personality by answering dialog questions, and the character will then talk more on his own accoriding to his personality, or the dialog choices will be more limited (you will see less of other choices)

personality quest after you reach limit, until you do it you dont see no other choices, if you succeed in change your personality will reset to 0

if you read this data on wiki you are spoling the game, if you read it contact us if some personality choice you would make doesnt agree with your personality




perma death might not work with personalities, or maybe some way to prevent perma death but it can still happen, and it can happen in quests as story choice



### Story

world has to feel like there is no magic like everything is somehow abstract/robotic but doesnt seem like it like a good place. janet seems like a robot but is something abstract. like the other guys, they seem like humans but are either abstract or demons which itself is abstract


There is a augment reality fighting game based on ancient card game. You will be on a tournament, and winning prize artifact will suck you inside the realm where the original game was played

cards create enemies like in yu gi oh

GameObject vs Component
GameObject can't hold data. If GameObject has just 1 component, it's a component.


Components
 * Transform
 * AttributeContainer
 * QuestGoer

GameObject


  * Hero
  * Skeleton
  * Sword


Quest
There is no quest without Hero game object, so it's not a game object
