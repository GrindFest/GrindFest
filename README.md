# Meta

name ideas
grindfest (doesnt really make sense)
game the game


# Setting
blood and magic, yu-gi-oh, the good place, wizard of legend, avatar, magic the gathering, heartstone, shadow of colossus, last guardian


# Story

you play the card game and win and play the real world card that transfers you to the game, thats special card for transfer between games, there can be same card that will transfer you back to game world (our real world)
you won't remember this

//world has to feel like there is no magic like everything is somehow abstract/robotic but doesnt seem like it like a good place. janet seems like a robot but is something abstract. like the other guys, they seem like humans but are either abstract or demons which itself is abstract
i think i've done this with oracle reality forming words

There is a augment reality fighting game based on ancient card game. You will be on a tournament, and winning prize artifact will suck you inside the realm where the original game was played
it reads the word on a card which was reverse engeneered to give instruction to reality engine a sofware for tournaments

programming note: can i make a image from hash of the source code of skill? 

cards create enemies like in yu gi oh


logging out means you get back to our realm 



## Alphabet
they have symbol for every word, every phrase you can possibly say
having the card on you will allow you to read the symbol and say it out loud, and the symbol means whatever it must mean in order to do the thing the skill does

the oracle created the symbols we dont know how 

## oracle
higher level mind of ai created universe real players are in, thats why he can suck you back into his real universe where true reality is 

in this way you are part of neural process of the oracle, thats why killing him will kill everyone
you are sucked into his world into "mechanical" avatar

## living machines
entities in oracles world are not machines but something like that, something that lives because its abstract not because it is biological or mechanical something third



# Areas
last guardian like style
at the start you have not to feel overwhelmed at all cost!
start at a tutorial dungeon, its a way to "sanctuary" the only town in world

after tutorial dungeon there has to be something that leads you to next easy dungeon, and only experienced players will go to the hub from where they can get everywhere
hub locked behind harder monsters or some game mechanic you don't know yet? easy dungeon locked behind easy monsters 



## Sanctuary
only safe area ("town") in world
there might be something weird but earth-like, like humanoids with deer heads or something abstract, but i dont know of abstract things that can interact with you and sell you stuff and look earth like - it could be statues. statues of deer people :)

 

there are ways to different dungeons like in shadow of colossus
but the area will be much smaller, and maybe just something like weird ruins in sotc
world has to feel empty, ambient sounds of nature, wind, lonely music, etc


## Dungeons
you have your own instance of a dungeon
max 4?
multi player dungeons decides role somewhere at the begging by doing some simple stuff
or maybe dialogs can be something like hello <player who first pushed the button>

player can allow other players to join their dungeons and kill them but they will permadeath if they die forcing you to create second character
dungeon without resurrect? other player can play monster cards to kill you

to enter dungeon you need dungeon card




all dungeons should be hard, the unlockable content has to be insane and not for normal players
dungeon that you can complete only at certain time (game time probably)


in story you get split and you get to see the other person on your screen via some magical video device so you can cooperate


hand-crafted dungeons?
generated dungons?

you need to change your skillset/playstyle for different dungeons


can dungeons be fun for both players if they have different skill levels? can i design them that way?

### Objects / Traps
platform with resurrect crystal, serves as teleportation point and also as resurrection platform



### skill dungeons
giving you skill card and training you specific skill
 
### tutorial dungeon

start the game blurry? so it seems like you were just transfer into avatars conciousnes (enter the void)

you decide which button activets which skill by game telling you to use it, and you press any button and it will bind the more you press it

ress crystal at the beggining will crack as you spawn first time 
you have to put new inside

you come to game and have 1 skill (play style)

guarantee ress crystal drop from first few easy enemies, so you can replenish

 until few minuts in game where you get 2 skill (two play styles) 

then you will get a choice of third supporting 1st or 2nd playstyle - it has to be obvious this change isnt permanent and you can buy both of those skills after some grind

first enemy is slow statue that will kill you in two hits, but when it hits you it will knock you back so you have few seconds to react
and he has to be much closer to you to hit you then you to hit him



### Controls
you can rebind only at test courses learnign you the abilities? that would be interesting but little tedious. but how often do you rebind? well it might happen if you create binding yourself
maybe it will tell you to press L1 for dash or any button you want, but if you press anything it will just bind that key
you were transferd to different realm, so maybe you lost your body and learning to use new one after all

every aspect of playing the game has to be part of the game itself (controls - described above, login - somehow, ambient music)
so you will feel more like the avatar, which is actually you even though at the start it seems that someone else was sucked in the game


### moral choices dungeon

perma-kill your friend? forced if wrong personality?

what is your name? real name (real life name), fake name (game nick name), dont say anything

### time dungeon
you will see yourself in future pushing button closing some path
in future you will be forced to push the button by falling rock or die

### Unlearn dungeon
hit the dummy and kill it, do it again, then hit the third dummy ant it attacks you. troll level


 
### oracle dungeon
oracle is giant neural network hidden in hub
oracle uses your real name
you fight on his different layers, last is something wrapping prefrontal cortex that humans dont have when you kill him there, hes dead
at the end you have option to fight oracle, after you die you are permabaned
if you kill the oracle then everyone is perma-killed, the world is wiped 

this universe is the thing that his pre precortex creates, something like our conciousnes created by brain of our number of layers




# Gameplay

there has to be nothing that would force player to backtrack though empty rooms (linear dungeons), or to force him to wait to heal (no healing skill, at least no replenishable by waiting)
player has to run through continous action

//probably not (too expensive): player customization, hair, something to make the avatar look like the person playing

playable on controller

there has to be no decisions that can't be reverted

there has to be no difference between new and old player in terms of how difficult it is to beat anything
critical hits? multi kills?

lack of content solved by players beying slow down by difficulty

this isn't necessary as cards are too abstract anywas: map transitions won't having map transitions break the immersion? wont not having them kill the supsense or create feeling of danger in safe places?

## Personality
dialog choices will have personality trait and value assigned to them, some will be locked, silence is by default, dialogs are forced if extreme personality by showing you only one options of what to say (or stay silent)


dont stop characters during dialog, allow them to move, never restrain character by game (or at least not without mentioning it)



personality, either 1 or 5 characteristics

you shape your character personality by answering dialog questions, and the character will then talk more on his own accoriding to his personality, or the dialog choices will be more limited (you will see less of other choices)

personality quest after you reach limit, until you do it you dont see no other choices, if you succeed in change your personality will reset to 0

if you read this data on wiki you are spoling the game, if you read it contact us if some personality choice you would make doesnt agree with your personality

permadeath can happen as a story choice


## Elements
unit types like in magic the gathering or heartstone
mechanical unit type
undead unit type

Elemental damage?
casting water spell and then electric spell


## Progression
No levels, no experience points

killing enemies must give you something - like ress crystal, so something that would balance your bad decisions in gameplay
no: i cant give you something like teleport crystal, because that would meen that moving through environment has to be painful

cards are skills, you need card slots in your card album. you gain card slots for something
you can have only 4 active cards


you can find bad things, like card you apply to dungeon that will cause you to get double damage, but you'll get more rewarded at the end


everything has to be about showing you that you are becoming better, that will be the point of playing more

you could play to get more play time? can that even work?


playstyle changing content can be available at start but it has to work like this:
 - 4 skills at the time
 - no changing skills inside battle 
 - all skills can be bought immediately for same low price that you will get to in few minutes of gameplay

so you wont need more then 4 skils



you gain small amounts of currency, maybe not for killing every enemy, but for completing certain parts of story/dungeon/quest/event

it has to be something abstract, like crystals or card slots and not money


card size? different card slots, in a book for cards?
shiny cards? special slots for them
shiny cards persist death?

every next skill cost more? unless you sell some skills? 


maybe i could lock content behind progression that is not grinding but completing other content - 
itself it won't work as i dont have infinite content, but with combination of other things it could be nother progression. but it locks content so you cant do everything from start. 
maybe unlock tier 1 -> 2 -> 3 dungeons that are harder versions. permanently! that it, if you unlock it permanently over perma death then its ok because that content is not for beginner skills anyway

lock content behind content? do i have to?
lock content that is too difficult and perma-unlock it after you finish easier content
this means it will never happen that you start the game and cant play hard dungeon with your friend, because you dont know how to play hard dungeon

it can never happen that i've done 1 hard dungeon and now i have to play easy dungeon to unlock another hard one
maybe it qcan if it requires different playstyle that you dont know, so normal with right playstyle - normal, normal with your wrong playstyle - hard. this means you can enjoy new playstyle in new dungeon even if its easier.


skills learnable at specific skill dungeon training you the skill

### Skills
learned at skill dungeon created to teach you how to use the skill.
first skill has to be simple to use attack skill, so AoE damage slot 1 skill
second skill will be something defensinve, like dash slot 2 skill
next is non-AoE attack skill changing way you attack enemies, so you decide which strategy you want to use. it's slot 1 skill
slot 3 skill option between two skills you choose which now and which sometime in near future (this has to be stressed)


skill cards different letters of their alphabet of different colots

two attack/defense skills - that might mean only 1 element attack option thats not enought 3 attacks is minimum. but with attack/defense option for each skill it would be 4 skills
directional cast, cast on self?


 * slash (aoe damage)
 * push everyone away from you (this could be slash cast on yourself)
 
 * long range projectile
 * navigated projectile
 * spread projectile
 
movement skill
 * dash, through enemies, pushing them
 * teleport, instantly move in direction facing without touching enemies
 
 
support skill
 * revert random? amount time, rewind position cooldowns and health back
 * reduce cooldowns of random? skill
 * no: healing skill, that would force players to wait, or not replenishable by time

secret skills (activate when condition is met)
 * when im thrown into a pit (not fall there myself / or maybe even if that happens) then do something
 * when i have less then x% of health, do something
 * when i am hit by elemental damage, next attack by that element will have anti-element modifier. so when i have fire skills and someone attacks me with fire skill my fire attack will deal water level damage against him //this wont help in pvp as players are not vurnable to elemental damage, and it will waste you a secret slot so you can use 2 same elements 
 


you can summon one monster card you have for help?


### monsters
everyone will always be attacking or moving - no need for idle animation
  guy with shield
  guy with long range weapon
  
  
  glowing eyes indicating some action
 
 
### Items
 * resurrect crystals, bigger resurrect crystals for larger dungeons?
 * card album pages
 * bigger card albums
 * monster cards for creating monsters to kill or just as collectible
 * probably not: real world card - its what you play to get in, not to get out, real world is the game (logout card) - card that get you in game is a logout card, and if you logout without it you perma-die
 * maybe: time card, you have to kill enemies to suck their life force to continue to play
 * dungeon card
 * dungeon modifier card 
   * allow players to kill me
   * double damage from monsters
   * card for easier dungeon?
 * healing item, more health will pour to healing pool that will be used when you are not around enemies to heal you
 
### card exchange
this gives me greater control over the economy as with currency i can't set value relationship between items
 * dungeon cards (regular dungeons, skill dungeons) for 3 different dungeon cards
 * skills but they are more expensive than skill dungeon cards for 3 different skill cards
 * bigger ressurect crystals for normal resurrect crystals
 * 6 skill cards -> 1 dungeon cards
 * 6 dungeon cards -> 1 skill card
 * 12 resurrect crystals -> 1 dungeon/skill card

price for skill cards has to increase with amount of skills you currently have

### Perma-death
Lose character, skills, card album, everything
unlocked dungeons stays unlocked
customizations stays unlocked

### Meta score
 - dungeon timers, leaderboards (including modifiers used)
 
 
 
# PvP
 ## Battle royal / king of the hill
 
# Monetization
 * character slots
   
1 character slot, you can buy more for real money - character personality is important so you will not want to kill your character

 
 no idea if there can be some material progress for intentional perma death as that would take long, maybe something cosmetic - like halo for sacrificing yourself

 * customization?


 
 

### unsorted
some skill can be assined only to work with right bumber and directed to where right stick is pointing on console and same with mouse look and mouse right click on pc

robe of any color you want but you have to find them


you can grind for resurrection crystals or something like that that will reconstruct your avatar, that when used at dungeon door will cause you to ressurect at the door - there will be altar. and if you dont want to use them you need no to. maybe for bigger rewards at the end - shiny cards?







# Development notes
There are missing folders, Game.js and Network folder should be on a same level


server can act either as zone server (for one zone) or as login server
i would have to git rid of static methods and put them to something like ZoneServer instance

is it zone -> world
or is it world -> zone

it might be zone -> world, and thinks like zoned, netstate, camera, controlls, rendering? shouldnt be components because they don't belong to world

problem is that it shouldnt be spriterenderer, it should be Visual, and rendering system should get this

what is camera then? camera is system, that targets hero
what if i want to cameras? its rendering system...camera is object inside rendering system

nodes can have storage for system data


what would hold actor id... actor component? that means he is an actor on server, thats same as netstate, isnt it?


zones will be separated, no fluid transitioning between zones


GameObject vs Component
GameObject can't hold data. If GameObject has just 1 component, it's a component.


Components
 * Transform
 * AttributeContainer
 * QuestGoer

GameObject


  * Hero
  * Skeleton
  * Sword


Quest
There is no quest without Hero game object, so it's not a game object
